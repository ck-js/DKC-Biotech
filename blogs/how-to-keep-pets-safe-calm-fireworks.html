        Hooray! It’s finally the festive holiday season once again and getting to spend time with friends and family is most peoples favorite time of the year filled with laughter, joy and relaxation but did you know that fireworks can be scary to our furry friends like cats and dogs?
    
    </p>

    <p  class="sub-heading2">
        Whether you’re celebrating Diwali (The festival of lights) in India, Loy Krathong in Thailand, Guy Fawkes in South Africa or any of the New Years Celebrations in iconic destinations such as the Sydney Opera House, The Bund overlooking the Shanghai cityscape or Times Square in New York. We are bound to setting off fireworks in close proximity to our furry friends and with their heightened sense of hearing, the bangs and booms can be more scary to them than we think. 

    </p>
    <p  class="sub-heading2">
        Fireworks can be a source of excitement and joy for many people, but for our furry friends, they can be a source of anxiety and stress. The loud noises and bright lights can cause fear and panic in dogs and other pets. As responsible pet owners, it's crucial to take proactive measures to keep our beloved pets calm and safe during firework displays.

    </p>
        
    <p  class="sub-heading2">
    Lets see if theres something we can do to try keep our pets calm and safe during firework displays.

</p>


    <h2>
Create a Safe Space Indoors

    </h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    One of the most important steps in keeping your pets calm during fireworks is to create a safe and secure space indoors where they can retreat to. Choose a quiet room or area in your home where your pets feel comfortable. This could be a bedroom, a basement, or any other space where they can find comfort. Make sure the room is well-ventilated and has familiar items such as their bed, toys, and blankets. Close the curtains or blinds to block out the bright lights and reduce noise from outside.
    
</p>
<h2>
Create a Comforting & Peaceful Environment
</h2>

<p class="sub-heading-2">
    To help your pets feel safe and relaxed, create a comforting environment in the designated safe space. Play some calming music or turn on a white noise machine to drown out the sound of fireworks. You can also use a pheromone diffuser or spray, specifically designed for pets, to create a sense of calm. Use blackout blinds or curtains to block bright flashes from the fireworks.
    
</p>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
        
    You may also consider a weighted vest or body fitting blanket that can help reduce anxiety and provide a snug and cozy feeling, if you are in a cold climate you may already have clothing items that can fulfill this task. If not, you can always improvise and create one with towels and fabric this could also be a fun arts and crafts afternoon for the kids. By kids we mean human kids not your firry kids…
</p>
<h2>
Keep Your Pets Busy and Distracted

</h2>
    <p class="sub-heading-2">
        Engaging with your pets in activities that keep their minds occupied and stimulated can help divert their attention from the fireworks. Consider giving them interactive toys or puzzle toys filled with treats. These toys can provide mental stimulation and help alleviate anxiety. Engage in playtime with your pets, using toys or games that they enjoy. This not only keeps them distracted but also strengthens the bond between you and your furry friend.
        
</p>    

<h2>
Use Positive Reinforcement and Calm Behavior
    
</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    During fireworks, it's important to remain calm and composed yourself. Pets can sense your emotions, so if you're anxious or stressed, it can further escalate their anxiety. Use positive reinforcement techniques to reward calm behavior. When your pet is relaxed or shows signs of calmness, such as lying down or sitting quietly, offer treats and praise. This reinforces the idea that being calm is a positive behavior.

</p>
<h2>
Consider Desensitization and Counterconditioning

</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Desensitization and counterconditioning techniques can be effective in helping pets overcome their fear of fireworks. These techniques involve gradually exposing your pets to the sound of fireworks in a controlled environment while providing positive experiences. Start by playing a recording of fireworks at a low volume and gradually increase the volume over time. Pair the sound of fireworks with treats, playtime, or other enjoyable activities. This helps your pets associate the sound of fireworks with positive experiences, reducing their fear and anxiety.
    
</p>

<h2>
Ensure Proper Identification and Safety Measures
</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Even with the best precautions, there is still a risk that your pet may escape or become disoriented during fireworks. It's crucial to ensure that your pets are properly identified with tags and microchips, and that their contact information is up to date. Consider keeping your pets indoors during fireworks displays and avoid leaving them unattended in the yard. If you must take them outside, always use a leash or harness to prevent them from running away.

</p>
<h2>
Leaving Pets Unattended 
    
</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    But, what if we are going to leave our pets unattended during the firework displays ?Maybe we’re going down to the Sydney Opera House with friends we haven’t seen in years or even lighting fireworks ourselves for Diwali but what should we do if our pets will be all alone ? We suggest all the tips and techniques from this article as well as some extra advice such as asking a friend or relative to doggy sit for the evening or asking your local dog shelter or vet clinic for their advice.
</p>
<h2>
Conclusion

</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    By following these tips and techniques, you can help keep your dogs and pets calm and safe during fireworks. Remember to create a safe space indoors, provide a comforting environment, keep them busy and distracted, use positive reinforcement, consider desensitization and counterconditioning, consult with your veterinarian if needed, and ensure proper identification and safety measures. With proper care and attention, you can help your pets navigate through fireworks displays with minimal stress and anxiety, ensuring their safety and well-being.
