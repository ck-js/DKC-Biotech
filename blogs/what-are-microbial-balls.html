        Lets be honest, if you are the owner of a service related business like a restaurant, cafe, hotel or any place of business where the bathroom, washroom or toilet experience can make or break your business from receiving good reviews and repeat returning customers.

    </p>

    <p  class="sub-heading2">
        Having a simple and easy to use cleaning supply solution like microbial balls can go a long way in providing your staff and customers a top notch washroom experience.

    </p>
    <p  class="sub-heading2">
        But what exactly are microbial balls? Glad you asked! 

    </p>
        
    <h2>
        What are microbial balls?

    </h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Microbial balls, also known as bio balls or biological balls, are used in toilets to help maintain a clean and odor-free environment. These balls contain beneficial bacteria that help break down organic waste and prevent the buildup of unpleasant odors. Here's what you need to know about microbial balls in toilets, bathroom and washroom for your business.

</p>
<h2>
    How do microbial balls work?

</h2>

<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Microbial balls work by introducing beneficial bacteria and enzymes into the toilet system. These bacteria are specifically selected for their ability to break down organic matter, such as feces and urine, and eliminate odor-causing compounds.

</p>
    
<h2>
    Can Microbial balls eliminate bad odors?

</h2>
    <p class="sub-heading-2">
        The bacteria and enzymes in microbial balls actively break down organic waste, reducing the production and build up of foul-smelling gases. This helps to control and eliminate unpleasant odors in the toilet.

</p>    

<h2>
    Are there any other benefits to using microbial balls?

</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Microbial balls can assist in breaking down other waste items, the beneficial bacteria in microbial balls accelerate the decomposition of organic waste, including toilet paper and other similar materials. This helps to prevent clogs and maintain the proper functioning of the toilet system.
</p>

<p class="sub-heading-2">
    This is especially true in countries where toilet paper is generally not flushed down the toilet, if your business is tourist facing, using microbial balls in your toilets can be extrememly useful because alot of foreigners and tourists are unaware of the harmful effect of flushing paper down a toilet that may cause clogs which cause downtime to your business toilet system.
</p>

<h2>
    Are microbial balls safe for the environment and sewage system?

</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    By promoting the natural and organic breakdown of waste, microbial balls can help reduce the need for harsh chemical cleaners and deodorizers. This makes them an environmentally friendly option for maintaining toilet hygiene.

</p>

<h2>
    How to use microbial balls?

</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Microbial balls are typically placed directly into the toilet bowl or tank. They can be used in both residential and commercial toilets, and are often used in public restrooms to ensure cleanliness and odor control.

</p>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Microbial balls can be placed anywhere liquids will pass through and you wish to have the general surface and surrounding areas to be sanitized and odorless such as urinals, toilet tanks and bowls, drain holes etc.
</p>

<h2>
    How long do microbial balls last?

</h2>
<p class="sub-heading-2">
    Depending on the brand and formulation, microbial balls can provide continuous odor control and waste breakdown for several weeks or even months. They gradually release the beneficial bacteria into the toilet system, ensuring ongoing effectiveness.

</p>

<p class="sub-heading-2">
    In conclusion, microbial balls are a great addition to your home or business cleaning supply collection as the benefits are wide spread across your staff, customers and are effective at eliminating smelly odors and breaking down organic matters aiding in a all round pleasant and enjoyable toilet, bathroom and washroom experience.
