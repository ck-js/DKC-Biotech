        <li>Making Compost with DKC Enzymes</li>
        <p>To make fragrant compost without the need for turning the pile, use the following method:</p>
        <p>- Gather agricultural waste materials such as plant residues, crop leftovers, and organic sludge from food processing industries.</p>
        <p>- For every 2,000 kg of these waste materials, add 1,000 grams of DKC Enzymes.</p>
        <p>- Additionally, add 2 kg of urea fertilizer and 10 kg of rock phosphate to the compost pile.</p>
        <p>The enzymes in DKC will break down the organic matter without requiring manual turning of the compost pile. This produces a nutrient-rich, fragrant compost that can be used as a soil amendment.</p>

        <li>Revitalizing Crop Seedlings and Controlling Soil-Borne Diseases</li>
        <p>DKC Enzymes can be used to rehabilitate degraded or stressed crop seedlings, as well as control soil-borne diseases when growing economic crops such as citrus, durian, chili, eggplant, cassava, melons, and more.</p>
        <p>DKC Enzymes have the ability to eliminate soil-borne bacteria and fungi that cause diseases like root rot, wilt, damping-off, and seedling blight.</p>
        <p>To prepare the soil, mix 1 kg of DKC Enzymes with 2,000 liters of water and apply the solution to the planting area at a rate of 1 rai (0.395 acres) per month. </p>
        <p>For maximum effectiveness, it is recommended to also incorporate organic matter or compost/manure into the soil at a rate of at least 2-3 tons per rai (0.395 acres) alongside the DKC Enzyme application.</p>
        <p>This combination helps revitalize stressed seedlings and control soil-borne diseases, leading to healthier crop growth.</p>

        <p>For nursing pigs and piglets, use 1.0 kg per 1 ton of feed</p>
        <p>For growing pigs and fattening pigs, use 0.35-0.50 kg per 1 ton of feed  </p>
        <p>For chickens, ducks, and quails, use 0.25-0.50 kg per 1 ton of feed</p>
    <p>For ruminants, use 0.20 kg per 1 ton of feed</p>
   <p>For aquatic animals like shrimp, fish, and frogs, use 0.5-1.0 kg per 1 ton of feed</p> 
   <p>For mixing in water for animals to drink to control diarrhea, use 1 kg of DKC per 2,000 liters of water. For smaller animals, use 1 kg per 1,000 liters of water.</p>
<li>For treating diarrhea:</li>
<p>Use 0.5 grams of DKC per 10 kg of animal body weight, mix with a small amount of water, and administer orally using a pump.</p>

<p>Use 1 kg of DKC mixed with 5,000 liters of water per 30-50 tons of animal manure. Spray the mixture onto the manure pile without needing to turn the pile.

    <ul>
        <li>Used in biogas digesters</li>
<p>Use 1 kg of DKC per 300-500 cubic meters of water entering the digester. This will result in an increase in the methane gas produced from the fermentation process, from 35-45% to 55-60%. Additionally, ammonia is reduced from 3-7% to 0.1-0.3%, and hydrogen sulfide is reduced from 0.3-0.7% to 0.01-0.03%. This allows for more methane gas to be used for electricity generation, helping to save on farm electricity costs.</p>

<li>Use to treat farm wastewater</li>
<p>For the initial treatment, use 3-5 kg of DKC per 1,000 cubic meters of wastewater. The DKC should be mixed with water and sprayed evenly over the waste pond. Then, every 15-30 days, use 1 kg of DKC.</p>

    <h4>Using DKC in Aquaculture Farms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use to eliminate unpleasant or foul odors in fish ponds, wastewater ponds, stagnant water areas, and weighing areas. This helps to break down and degrade organic matter that causes foul odors, and reduces toxic gases like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and rancid odors. The enzymes break these down into carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen gas, which are odorless.</li>
<p>Use 1 kg of DKC per 2,000-3,000 liters of water. Spray it evenly over the affected areas when there are unpleasant odors. This can quickly eliminate the unwanted odors, and the effects can last for an extended period after the initial application.</p>

        <p>Use 1 kg of DKC per rai (1,600 sq.m), mix it with water and broadcast it over the pond's surface while the aeration system is running. Repeat this for 3 consecutive days.</p>
        <h6>Recommendations</h6>
        <li>Do not store DKC in damp or excessively hot conditions.</li>
        <li>Do not use DKC concurrently with disinfectants. It is </li>

<div class="card-items">
    <h4>Using DKC in Aquaculture Farms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use DKC to eliminate foul odors and toxic gases in the fish storage compartment under the boat's hull. This is because fish harvesting often takes several days, so the caught fish may not have been sufficiently chilled, leading to spoilage and the production of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide gases. If workers enter the storage compartment to collect the fish, they risk exposure to these toxic gases, which can be fatal.
        </li>
        <p>Mix 500 grams of DKC with 500 liters of water and spray/sprinkle it in the fish storage compartment 1-2 hours before the boat docks. This helps reduce/eliminate the foul odor and toxic gases, while also preserving the quality of the fish.</p>

    <h4>Using DKC Enzymes in Aquaculture Farms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use DKC to improve the quality of fish meal
            Fish offal or fish processing waste that is used to produce fish meal often has poor quality, up to the point of being rotten and foul-smelling. When these materials are steamed, the resulting smoke has a putrid, rancid odor, and the produced fish meal also has a low quality with a foul, rotten smell. This is indicated by a high Total Volatile Nitrogen (TVN) value, resulting in a lower grade of fish meal.</li>
        <p>Use 1 kg of DKC mixed with 1,000 liters of water, and spray/sprinkle it onto a 30,000 kg pile of fish, in the area before the fish is loaded into the steaming vessel or along the fish transfer conveyor. This ensures the water-enzyme mixture has maximum contact with the fish, for optimal effectiveness.</p>
