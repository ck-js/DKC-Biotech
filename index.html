    <h4>Using DKC to Remove Odors and Unclog Toilets</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>For foul odors in the bathroom and clogged toilets</li>
        <p>use 100 grams of DKC. Pour it into the toilet bowl and flush. The unpleasant odor and clogging will be resolved within 2-3 days. This also helps save money by preventing the problem of overflowing toilets. It's recommended to use DKC in the toilet regularly every 30-60 days.</p>
        <li>Removing Urine Odors from Urinals and Floors</li>
        <p>To remove urine odors, use a ratio of 10 grams or 1 tablespoon of DKC per 20 liters of water. Scoop up around 100 cc of the microbial solution and pour it directly into the urinal. The urine odor will disappear within 1-2 minutes.</p>
        <li>For the bathroom floor</li>
        <p>use a mop soaked in the microbial solution to clean the floor, especially along the edges and in corners where odors tend to linger. There is no need to use any deodorizing chemicals, as the unpleasant odors will be eliminated for several hours.</p>
        <p>It's recommended to use this treatment when odors are present, or as a regular maintenance every 1-3 days.</p>

            As a pet owner, I am always concerned about the safety of the chemicals used to deodorize pet areas. With DKC Enzymes Deodorize Product, I no longer have to worry. It is completely safe and has no harmful chemicals, yet still effectively removes any unpleasant odors. My cat's litter box and my dog's cage smell fresh and clean after using this product. Highly recommended!
