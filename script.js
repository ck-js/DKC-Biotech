To set the image seen when sharing a link, you can use the Open Graph protocol or the Twitter Card markup. These protocols provide metadata that social media platforms use to display a specific image when a link is shared. Here's how you can set the image using each method:

1. Open Graph Protocol:
   - Add the following `<meta>` tags to the `<head>` section of your HTML page, specifying the image URL:
     ```html
     <meta property="og:image" content="./assets/">
     <meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="">
     <meta property="og:image:alt" content="DKC amzymes logo banner">
     <meta property="og:image:type" content="image/jpeg">
     <meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
     <meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
     ```
     Replace `"https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg"` with the actual URL of your desired image. You can also specify alternative text, image type, width, and height if needed.

2. Twitter Card Markup:
   - Add the following `<meta>` tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML page, specifying the image URL:
     ```html
     <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg">
     ```
     Replace `"https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg"` with the actual URL of your desired image.

Make sure to include the appropriate markup on the page you want to share. Once you update the `<head>` section with the correct metadata, social media platforms should use the specified image when the link is shared. Keep in mind that different platforms may have caching mechanisms, so it may take some time for the changes to take effect.
